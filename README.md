## Technical

### Big O Notation

Learn about the fundamental concept of Big O notation, which is used to analyze the efficiency of algorithms and their performance as input size increases.

## Data Structures

### Lists

Explore the basic list data structure and learn about operations like insertion, deletion, and accessing elements.

### Linked Lists

Dive into linked lists, a linear data structure, and understand how they work along with various operations and variations.

### Doubly Linked Lists

Learn about doubly linked lists, an extension of linked lists that allow traversal in both directions.

### Stacks & Queues

Understand the concepts of stacks and queues, two fundamental abstract data types, and their applications in solving real-world problems.

### Binary Trees

Discover binary trees and their variants, including binary search trees, and learn about their properties and traversal techniques.

### Hash Tables

Explore hash tables and how they enable efficient data retrieval through key-value pairs, along with collision resolution strategies.

### Heaps

Learn about binary heaps, a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, and their use cases.

### Graphs

Delve into graph theory and learn about graph data structures, traversal algorithms, and their applications in various domains.

## Algorithms

### Sorting
